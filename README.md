**For when you really just want to serve some files over HTTP/s right now!**

**midserve** is a ~~small~~ (not that small), self-contained cross-platform CLI tool that allows you to just grab the binary and serve some file(s) via HTTP/s.

Inspired by [miniserve](https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve).

 ## What do I need?

- [ ] `min-size`: Because it is go, so I will try to keep go.mod clean, at least not use any stuff that will make the binary much larger.

- [ ] `HTTPS support`

- [ ] [`Exclude or Include`](https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve/issues/458)

- [ ] [`Regexp support`](https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve/issues/458)

- [ ] `QR code support`

- [ ] `auth`
